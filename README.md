# 🌍 Global Migration Pattern Analysis (1960–2020)

## 📌 Project Overview
Migration patterns are frequently used in political rhetoric to frame specific populations or regions.  
To move beyond narratives and toward evidence-based understanding, this project analyzes large-scale international migration data to identify long-term patterns, dominant sender regions, and regional migration dynamics.

The analysis is based on a comprehensive dataset containing **~2.9 million observations** across **56,000+ country pairs** spanning **1960 to 2020**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Identify long-term migration trends across countries
- Examine major migrant-sending nations
- Understand regional migration dominance and directionality
- Assess whether global migration is unidirectional or regionally circular

## 📊 Key Analyses & Insights

### 1️⃣ Out-Migration Trend: India
India’s out-migration exhibits a **clear long-term upward trend**, with noticeable acceleration after the 1990s.
This aligns with:
- Economic liberalization
- Global labor demand expansion

A sharp spike in the late 2010s suggests migration driven primarily by **employment opportunities**, rather than conflict-driven displacement seen in countries such as Afghanistan or Iran.

---

### 2️⃣ Migration Chord Diagram: Top 3 Sender Countries
The chord diagram reveals that the **top three sending countries** in the dataset are:
- Germany  
- Italy  
- Poland  

Migration from these countries is largely associated with:
- Labor mobility
- Economic opportunity seeking
- Intra-regional movement rather than forced migration

This challenges the assumption that major migration flows originate primarily from unstable regions.

---

### 3️⃣ Net Migration Flows by Region (Directional Dominance)
Regional aggregation highlights distinct migration roles:

- **Europe:**  
  Acts as a stable migration hub with strong internal circulation and retention

- **Asia:**  
  Functions as a global sender with distributed, multi-directional outflows rather than a one-way drain

- **Africa:**  
  Net inflows largely reflect **regional mobility**, not international pull factors

- **Middle East:**  
  Serves predominantly as a **temporary labor destination**, with limited long-term settlement

---

## 🧠 Key Conclusion
Global migration is **not globally unidirectional**.  
Instead, it is **regionally concentrated, circular, and economically driven**.

These findings highlight the importance of:
- Evidence-based migration policy
- Controlled and humane migration frameworks
- Avoiding discriminatory narratives rooted in misinterpretation of migration data

---
